# JavaScript Calculator - Mayerfeld Front-end Developer Practicum Program

## About
The main goal of this project was to create a Calculator in JavaScript (without
the use of external libraries/frameworks) with these requisites:

### Requisites 
1. Create functions for all of the basic math operators that are typically found
   on simple calculators (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide);
2. Create a new function that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one
   of the above functions on the numbers;
3. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above
   functions and an “Equals” key:
    - There should also be a display for the calculator;
        - Add a “clear” button.
4. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number
   buttons and store the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the
   next step;
5. Store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses
   an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate()
   on them when the user presses the “=” key;
6. Make sure that the user can string together several operations and get the
   right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time;
7. Let users input decimals;
8. Add backspace button;
9. Add keyboard support;
